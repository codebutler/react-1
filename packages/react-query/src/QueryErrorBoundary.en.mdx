### Motivation

With the [QueryErrorResetBoundary](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/reference/QueryErrorResetBoundary) component you can reset any query errors within the boundaries of the component. but If you use react-query with suspense continuously, Continuous repeating to use QueryErrorResetBoundary + [ErrorBoundary](/docs/react/src/ErrorBoundary.i18n) will be coded.

#### QueryErrorResetBoundary + ErrorBoundary

```tsx
import { ErrorBoundary } from '@suspensive/react'
import { QueryErrorResetBoundary } from '@tanstack/react-query'

const Example = () => (
  <QueryErrorResetBoundary>
    {({ reset }) => (
      <ErrorBoundary onReset={reset} fallback={(boundary) => <button onClick={boundary.reset}>Try again</button>}>
        <Page />
      </ErrorBoundary>
    )}
  </QueryErrorResetBoundary>
)
```

### peerDependency

QueryErrorBoundary in below code have peerDependency on @suspensive/react's ErrorBoundary.
So if you want to use these, you must install @suspensive/react first.

```shell
npm install @suspensive/react @suspensive/react-query
```

```shell
pnpm add @suspensive/react @suspensive/react-query
```

```shell
yarn add @suspensive/react @suspensive/react-query
```

@suspensive/react-query provide QueryErrorBoundary to reduce repeating implementation like using QueryErrorResetBoundary + ErrorBoundary.

## QueryErrorBoundary

```tsx
import { QueryErrorBoundary } from '@suspensive/react-query'

const Example = () => (
  <QueryErrorBoundary fallback={(boundary) => <button onClick={boundary.reset}>Try again</button>}>
    <Page />
  </QueryErrorBoundary>
)
```

You can just use QueryErrorBoundary like using [ErrorBoundary](/docs/react/src/ErrorBoundary.i18n). All other features are same with original ErrorBoundary of @suspensive/react without resetting react-query's error.
